PHOENIX MATRIX SOVEREIGN ARCHITECTURE
[STATUS]: 18-Repository Substrate Consolidated
[FUTURE ENHANCEMENT]: Needs continuous formal verification scaling and HDF5 vector optimizations.
[POTENTIAL LOOPHOLE]: Ensure strict hardware isolation when deploying to bare-metal. Watch for timing side-channels.
[ERROR PRONE AREA]: Concurrency bottlenecks in event bus and race conditions in cross-domain memory mappings.
