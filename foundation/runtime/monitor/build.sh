# PHOENIX MATRIX SOVEREIGN ARCHITECTURE
# [STATUS]: 18-Repository Substrate Consolidated
# [FUTURE ENHANCEMENT]: Needs continuous formal verification scaling and HDF5 vector optimizations.
# [POTENTIAL LOOPHOLE]: Ensure strict hardware isolation when deploying to bare-metal. Watch for timing side-channels.
# [ERROR PRONE AREA]: Concurrency bottlenecks in event bus and race conditions in cross-domain memory mappings.
